# Joomla Podcast Feed

This little bit of code allows for a podcast feed to be generated on the fly from from data stored in a Joomla database.

It's hardcoded PHP used to generate the data from K2 specificly but can be altered to be pulled from Joomla core instead.

Use this to submit your site to the iTunes store or any other source that needs the RSS data in podcast format.
